        <p>"Park Planner" was an interactive installation featured in the Smithsonian's "FUTURES" exhibition at the Arts and Industries Building. This engaging experience allowed visitors to design their ideal park by selecting various futuristic elements such as kinetic energy basketball courts, robot petting zoos, and solar panel arrays. As participants made their choices, the installation provided feedback on the environmental and social impacts of their designs, fostering a deeper understanding of sustainable urban planning. By blending agency with education, "Park Planner" inspired visitors to envision and contribute to the development of greener, more inclusive public spaces.</p>

            <p>"Virtual Sungazing on the National Mall" was an educational initiative developed by the Smithsonian Science Education Center to help first-grade students observe and understand the Sun's apparent daily motion across the sky. Utilizing 360-degree panoramic photographs taken from the National Mall, this program allowed students to virtually track the Sun's path during different seasons, providing a safe and interactive learning experience. The project was highlighted in the National Science Teaching Association's journal, Science and Children, in an article titled "Virtual Sungazing," co-authored by Dr. Sarah Glassman and Ryan Seymour.
            This resource served as a valuable tool for educators aiming to teach young learners about Earth's rotation and the resulting patterns of daylight.</p>
