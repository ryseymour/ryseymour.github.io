                        <p>"Sunlight on the National Mall" was an innovative educational project that utilized 360-degree panoramic photographs to illustrate the Sun's apparent daily motion across the sky. This immersive experience allowed students to observe and predict the Sun's patterns during different seasons, enhancing their understanding of daylight variations throughout the year. The project was featured in the National Science Teaching Association's article, "<a href="https://www.nsta.org/science-and-children/science-and-children-novemberdecember-2020/virtual-sungazing">Virtual Sungazing</a>," which detailed its implementation and educational impact.</p>
